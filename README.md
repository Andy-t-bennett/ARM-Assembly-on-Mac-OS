# ARM Assembly on macOS

A hands-on guide to learning ARM64 assembly language on macOS (Apple Silicon). This course takes you from zero to building your own interpreter and beyond!

## Why This Guide?

Most ARM assembly resources target Linux or embedded systems. This guide is specifically designed for **Apple Silicon Macs** (M1/M2/M3/M4), covering the macOS-specific calling conventions, syscalls, and tooling.

## Who Is This For?

- Developers curious about what's happening "under the hood"
- Anyone wanting to understand low-level programming
- People interested in performance optimization, reverse engineering, or OS development
- No prior assembly experience needed! Just bring curiosity and patience
